As far as I can tell, Packt Publishing does not make its datasets available online unless you buy the book and create a user account which can be a problem if you are checking the book out from the library or borrowing the book from a friend. All of these datasets are in the public domain but simply needed some cleaning up and recoding to match the format in the book.\n\n## Content\n**Columns**\n - age: age of primary beneficiary \n\n - sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male \n\n - bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,\n            objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9 \n\n - children: Number of    children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents\n\n - smoker: Smoking\n\n - region: the beneficiary\u0027s residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.\n\n - charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe dataset is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets).\n\n## Inspiration\nCan you accurately predict insurance costs?"}
